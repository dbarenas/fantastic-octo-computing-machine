# This __init__.py file makes the 'models' directory a Python package.

# If using SQLAlchemy or a similar ORM, you would typically import your model classes here
# to make them easily accessible when the SQLAlchemy setup in db.database.py is activated.
#
# Example (if these files contained actual SQLAlchemy model classes):
#
# from .document_model import DocumentModel
# from .extracted_data_model import ExtractedDataModel
# from .validation_result_model import ValidationResultModel
#
# __all__ = [
# "DocumentModel",
# "ExtractedDataModel",
# "ValidationResultModel",
# ]
#
# This allows for imports like: `from db.models import DocumentModel`

# Currently, these are placeholder files. The actual database schema is created
# directly in `db/database.py` using SQLite DDL for simplicity.
# If migrating to SQLAlchemy, the model files (document_model.py, etc.) would be
# completed and imported here.

print("db.models package initialized. Contains placeholder ORM model files.")
