# Orquestador principal
# This script serves as the main entry point or orchestrator for the document processing system.
# Its responsibilities could include:
#
# 1.  **Input Acquisition**: Monitoring a directory for new documents,
#     receiving documents from a message queue, or providing a CLI interface
#     to submit documents for processing. (For API-driven ingestion, `api.py` is the entry point).
# 2.  **Pipeline Initiation**: For each acquired document, it instantiates and runs
#     the `DocumentProcessingPipeline` from `pipeline.py`.
# 3.  **Configuration Management**: Loading system-wide configurations from `config.py`.
# 4.  **Logging Setup**: Initializing global logging settings.
# 5.  **Concurrency/Batching**: Managing concurrent pipeline executions or batching
#     documents for processing, if applicable.
# 6.  **Error Handling & Reporting**: Top-level error catching and reporting mechanisms.
#
# The `api.py` provides a FastAPI interface which can also initiate the pipeline
# for documents uploaded via HTTP. `main.py` could be used for batch processing
# or other non-API driven workflows.

# Example (conceptual):
# from pipeline import DocumentProcessingPipeline
# from config import WATCHED_FOLDER, PROCESSED_FOLDER, ERROR_FOLDER
# import time
# import os
# import logging

# def setup_logging():
#     # Basic logging setup, could be more sophisticated using config.py
#     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# def process_single_document(doc_path, file_name, file_type):
#     logging.info(f"Processing document: {doc_path}")
#     try:
#         pipeline = DocumentProcessingPipeline(
#             document_path=doc_path,
#             file_name=file_name,
#             file_type=file_type
#         )
#         result = pipeline.run() # result is a ProcessedDocument object
#         logging.info(f"Finished processing {file_name}. Status: {result.metadata.processing_status}")
#         # Move file to PROCESSED_FOLDER or ERROR_FOLDER based on result.metadata.processing_status
#         # e.g., os.rename(doc_path, os.path.join(PROCESSED_FOLDER, file_name))
#     except Exception as e:
#         logging.error(f"Critical error processing {doc_path}: {e}", exc_info=True)
#         # Move file to ERROR_FOLDER
#         # e.g., os.rename(doc_path, os.path.join(ERROR_FOLDER, file_name))


# def watch_folder_for_processing():
#     setup_logging()
#     logging.info(f"Watching folder {WATCHED_FOLDER} for new documents...")
#     while True:
#         for filename in os.listdir(WATCHED_FOLDER):
#             file_path = os.path.join(WATCHED_FOLDER, filename)
#             if os.path.isfile(file_path): # Basic check, could add extension check
#                 _, file_ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
#                 # Add more robust file type detection if needed
#                 logging.info(f"New file detected: {filename}")
#                 process_single_document(file_path, filename, file_ext)
#         time.sleep(10) # Check every 10 seconds
